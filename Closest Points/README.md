# [K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/description/)

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `√(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).
